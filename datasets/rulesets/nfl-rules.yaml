## WikiProject National Football League rules defining certain classes
## of articles having certain importance ratings.

## For definition of the rule format, see
## https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Automated_classification_of_article_importance/Importance_API_draft#Side_chain

## NOTE: This is just an example, it will not be applied in practice because
## Wikidata does not separate between NFL seasons and individual team seasons.
